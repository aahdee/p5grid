# p5grid
An implementation of triangle, square, hexagon, and octagon girds for p5.js. Currently a work in progress with hex almost done. Hella hella alpha.

This started because I found [this website](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) years ago and decided to make something of it. Because of this I'm creating libs for triangles, octagons, and squares as well.

Disclaimer: Be weary about updating this lib. It's likely that your code may break. I will try to keep a changelog for each commit.

Here's my [twitter](https://twitter.com/aah_dee_), if you'd like to know more about me.

### Special Thanks
