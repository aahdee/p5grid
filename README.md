# p5grid
An implementation of triangle, square, hexagon, and octagon girds for p5.js. Currently a work in progress with hex almost done. Hella hella alpha.

This started because I found this website (https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) years ago and decided to make something of it. Because of this I'm creating libs for triangles, octagons, and squares as well.
