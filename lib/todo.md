# To-do
- Implementation of transformation of the entire grid and scaling.
- No fill when drawing Hexes such that there can be a wireframe grid.
- Remove originPixel for the transition to `push()` and `pop()` feature
- Edit names of some functions for clarity and quality of life.
- Change arguments names and delete unnecessary arguments.
- Let `getRotate()` rotate a Hex around a Hex that is not the origin.
- fix origin properties. let origin pixel be based on screen.
