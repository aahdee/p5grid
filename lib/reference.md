# p5grid Reference

This is an work in progress reference for my implementation of grids in p5.js. Before continuing, I highly suggest that you read this [hexagonal grid guide](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) by Red Blob Games. It's what I based my hexagon implementation on and inspired me to create implementations for triangles, squares, and octagons, so it will give you a good understanding of the coordinate systems and how to properly use the library. It's also a beautiful guide so I still urge you to check it out if you're experienced to appreciate their handiwork.

## hexgrid.js
### Hex()
**Syntax:**`Hex(q, r, s)`  
This constructor creates a hexagon with the coordinates q, r, and s.

## trigrid.js
Implementation coming soon!

## sqrgrid.js
Implementation coming soon!

## octgrid.js
Implementation coming soon!
